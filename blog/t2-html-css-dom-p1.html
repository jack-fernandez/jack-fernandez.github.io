      Q:  Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML,
      CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?<br>
      A: HTML is the outline of the website.
      CSS is the style of the website.
      DOM im not 100% sure yet so im not going to write something.<br><br>
      Q:  What is meant by boxifying design?<br>
      A: A boxifying design is a basic grid that you can layout your page easily.<br><br>
      Q: What is the box model?<br>
      A: All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS,
      the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
      The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element.
      It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.<br>
