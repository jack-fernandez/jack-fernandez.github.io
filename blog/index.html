                  Hi everybody my name is Jack. I'm studying at Dev
                  Academy in Mt Eden I find Dev Academy interesting
                  because i find it hard but fun to learn new things.
                  I love creating code then testing it sometimes it
                  ends out looking good or you can really mess the code up
                  and have to start again but that's what im here to learn
                  and practice.</strong></p>

                  ⦿ Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a standardized system for tagging
                   text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World
                    Wide Web pages.<br /><br />
                  ⦿ A cascading style sheet (CSS) is a Web page derived from multiple
                  sources with a defined order of precedence where the definitions of any style
                   element conflict.<br /><br />
                  ⦿ JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is
                   a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web
                    browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
                     programmatic control over them.<br /><br />
                  ⦿ Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
                   class-based,
                   object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation
                    dependencies as possible.
