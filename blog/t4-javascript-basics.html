           Q: How does JavaScript compare
           to HTML and CSS? <br>
           A: HTML and CSS are for the structure
           and the design mean while javascript is
           for responsive design and interactive
           functionality.<br /><br />
           Q: Explain control flow and loops
           using an example process from
           everyday life, for example 'waking
           up' or 'brushing your teeth'.<br>
           A: Loops define repitition, and daily
           activities like waking up and brushing
           can be considered repititious. There
           is a level of subconscious flow-control
           involved because we have 'break/check-points'
           to make sure activities flow smoothly,
           and in the proper order e.g. open door
           first, before walking through, apply
           paste to brush before choosing to brush
           teeth.<br><BR />
           Q: Explain the difference between
           accessing data from arrays and
           objects.<br>
           A: Data can be accessed from arrays
           using numeric index positions, even
           for nested array situations. Accessing
           data from object literals is slightly
           different - being akin to getting
           the value using 'keys'. The object
           literals have a property value system.<br><br />
           Q:  Explain what functions are
           and why they are useful.<br>
           A: Functions help follow the DRY principle
           in software programming. It is convenient
           to be able to name a set of code as a
           function and invoke/call the function
           instead of having to write the same
           set of code multiple times in a program<br><br />
